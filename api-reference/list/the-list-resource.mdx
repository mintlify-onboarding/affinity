title: The List Resource
description: Lists are the primary data structure that you can interact with in Affinity. Each list manages a collection of either people, organizations or opportunities. We call people, organizations and opportunities "entities".
---

A list in Affinity is easily represented as a spreadsheet. The rows of the spreadsheet are the list entries, and each list entry corresponds to a single person in a list of people, an organization in a list of organizations or an opportunity in a list of opportunities.

Lists in Affinity can also have any number of custom attributes. These attributes allow you to fully customize your workflow and model the data for your use case. We call these attributes "fields", and each fields represents a column in the spreadsheet representation.

As a simple example: A list called "Important People" might have 25 people in it. Two of the columns in the sheet could be "Title" and "Industry".

This list would have 25 "list entries". Each list entry would be associated with a single person entity. Furthermore, the list would have two "fields" with the names "Title" and "Industry".
